### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 was one of my favorite labs to do because it was the beginning of being able to use text inputs through the terminal and seeing the outputs being created from those inputs. Even though it was a simple program, it is a start into being able to learn much more advanced things later on in the course.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2, was another of my favorites because of the whole premise of the code we where making. It was fun but also educational to see how a simple game could be made. While I don't know how to make it involve 2 devices as we could see the beginging inputs, it was still fun for everyone in the group to be involved.  

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 is another of my favorites because it was the introduction of command line arguments. I knew that there was a way to be able to not need to input arguments 1 by 1 but I just never looked into it. This lab showed me how how to do it while also giving me ways that this form of input can be used. Overall, it showed me how to make a program simpler to get outputs without waiting for each query.
